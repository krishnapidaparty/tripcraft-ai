- Make sure the key has sufficient credits

**3. Port issues**
- Replit automatically handles port configuration
- The app should run on the default port

**4. Import errors**
- Check that all files are in the correct directory structure
- Ensure `app/main.py` exists and is properly formatted

### Getting Help

- Check the Replit console for error messages
- Verify your environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure your GitHub repository is public (for Replit import)

## üåê Alternative Deployment Options

### Railway
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard
3. Deploy automatically

### Heroku
1. Create a Heroku account
2. Install Heroku CLI
3. Run: `heroku create your-app-name`
4. Add environment variables: `heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`
5. Deploy: `git push heroku main`

### Vercel
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure as a Python project
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy automatically

## üì± Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these features:

1. **Homepage** - Should load the travel planner form
